/**
 * GET /api/cron/inventory-sweep — the catalog-wide oversell guard. Feed-aware pass over
 * EVERY active tracked Shopify variant (not just today-changed ones): reconciles each variant
 * DOWN toward its buffered feed target — 0 when the SKU is absent from the Aosom feed OR
 * feed_qty <= STOCK_SOLD_OUT_MAX (so inventory_policy=deny blocks the sale), else feed_qty-3.
 * Downward-safe: writes a variant down whenever Shopify sits ABOVE the cap (over-count,
 * threshold change, failed push) and self-heals a fully-zeroed variant (0→N), but never tops a
 * sold-down nonzero variant back up (that would reopen intraday oversell against the 06:00
 * feed; left to the change-gated push). Writes only on a difference → idempotent. Variant-level
 * (live siblings keep selling), no drafting. Aborts before
 * any write if the feed covers < 80% of active tracked variants (truncated-feed guard); a per-run
 * WRITE_CAP bounds blast radius (convergent). Protected by CRON_SECRET (Bearer), Shopify writes
 * rate-limited to 2 req/sec. cron_runs detail "scanned=N zeroed=X restored=Y …". Runs after the
 * daily Shopify push.
