# Data Operations Log

Audit trail for manual/destructive operations against the production Turso database.
Each entry records the date, the exact rules, and the exact row counts affected.

## 2026-06-06 — Purge stale + broken facebook_drafts

Ran after a read-only dry-run (`scripts/drafts-purge-diagnostic.mjs`) was validated by Mat.
Applied as a single atomic write transaction.

**Rules (status `draft` only for rule a; rules b/c by explicit id):**
- (a) `trigger_type IN ('new_product','stock_highlight') AND status='draft' AND created_at < now-30d`
  — note: `created_at` is a UNIX epoch integer, so the threshold used
  `cast(strftime('%s','now','-30 days') as integer)`, **not** `datetime('now','-30 days')`.
- (b) draft `id = 352` — empty caption (incomplete generation).
- (c) draft `id = 308` — saved LLM error text ("Je ne vois pas les variables {{season}}…").

**Deleted (exact `rowsAffected`):**
| Rule | Rows |
| --- | --- |
| (a) stale product drafts > 30d | 284 |
| (b) id 352 (empty) | 1 |
| (c) id 308 (LLM error) | 1 |
| **Total** | **286** |

**Guarantee:** rule (a) targets only the two product trigger types, so **no
`content_template` draft was removed except the two explicit ids** (#352, #308).
`content_template` drafts went 18 → 16; the 16 remaining are intact for review.

**Post-purge distribution:** 90 rows total, 27 in `status='draft'`
(content_template 16, new_product 5, stock_highlight 6).
