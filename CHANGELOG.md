# Changelog

All notable changes to Aosom Sync will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.5.1] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed
- Social Media drafts now show the product photo thumbnail instead of a broken image icon. Drafts generated on Vercel stored a `/tmp/...` filesystem path as the image source, which 404'd in the browser. The UI now skips those internal paths and falls back to the public Aosom CDN image URL.

## [0.1.5.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- Multi-brand social publishing: one click posts to Facebook Ameublo Direct (FR), Facebook Furnish Direct (EN), and Instagram Ameublo Direct (FR)
- Bilingual caption generation: every draft now stores both FR and EN captions, generated in parallel via Claude
- Per-channel publish state tracked in drafts (published / error / pending) with retry button per failed channel
- "Retry all failed" button on drafts with one or more channel errors
- New Instagram Graph API client (2-step media container + publish flow)
- Auto-post on price drop with configurable minimum drop %, daily limit, and channel selection (settings: social_autopost_enabled, social_autopost_min_drop_percent, social_autopost_max_per_day, social_autopost_channels)
- FR/EN preview tab on draft cards and dual-language editor
- New env vars: FACEBOOK_APP_ID, FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET, FACEBOOK_AMEUBLO_PAGE_ID/TOKEN, FACEBOOK_FURNISH_PAGE_ID/TOKEN, INSTAGRAM_AMEUBLO_ACCOUNT_ID

### Changed
- facebook-client.ts now takes a `brand` parameter ("ameublo" | "furnish") to resolve the correct Page ID + token
- facebook_drafts table: added `post_text_en` and `channels` columns (JSON per-channel state) via in-place migration
- /api/social publish action splits into legacy `publish` (single channel, back-compat) and new `publish-multi` (parallel fan-out)

### Notes
- Instagram Furnish Direct is not yet configured (account doesn't exist yet); the code path is ready and activates automatically when `INSTAGRAM_FURNISH_ACCOUNT_ID` is set
- Legacy `FACEBOOK_PAGE_ID` / `FACEBOOK_PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN` env vars are kept as deprecated fallbacks for one release and will be removed in 0.1.6.0

## [0.1.4.1] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- Rate limiting on Claude API (30 calls/min) and Shopify push (60 calls/min) endpoints to prevent accidental cost spikes

## [0.1.4.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- Bulk generate: process all pending products to Shopify in one click with "Generate All Pending"
- Select individual products with checkboxes, then "Generate Selected" for partial batches
- Live progress bar with success/error counters and estimated time remaining
- "Stop" button to cancel a bulk operation mid-batch
- "Retry Failed" button to re-process only errored products
- Confirmation dialog before starting bulk operations
- 5th stat card showing error count

### Changed
- Import page now shows checkboxes for pending products and "Select all pending" toggle
- Status badges show "importing..." during Shopify push phase

## [0.1.3.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- Products are now automatically placed into the correct Shopify collection when imported, based on their Aosom category
- New /collections page to view and edit category-to-collection mappings with dropdown selectors
- "Sync Collections" button to assign existing Shopify products to their mapped collections in batch
- 35 pre-seeded mappings covering all 8 top-level Aosom categories (Patio, Home, Pets, Toys, Office, Sports, etc.)
- Hierarchical category matching: if "Patio > Furniture > Bistro Sets" has no exact mapping, it walks up to "Patio > Furniture" automatically
- Collections link added to the sidebar navigation

### Changed
- Collection sync uses in-memory mapping lookup instead of per-product DB queries (N+1 fix)

## [0.1.1.0] - 2026-04-06

### Changed
- Image composer now uses dynamic import for sharp, reducing cold start time on Vercel
- Social media images write to /tmp on Vercel (public/ is read-only in serverless)
- Facebook publish resolves image paths cross-environment via resolveImagePath()
- Sync engine loads all products in one query instead of one per CSV row (N+1 fix for 10k+ products)
- Stock change detection uses Set instead of Array.find() (O(1) vs O(n) per lookup)

## [0.1.0.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- Dashboard with sync overview, price drops, fastest selling, and recent sync runs
- Catalogue browser with 10k+ Aosom products, filters by category/price/stock/color, pagination
- Daily sync engine: fetch Aosom CSV feed, diff against Shopify, auto-apply price and stock changes
- Import pipeline: select products from catalogue, generate bilingual FR/EN content via Claude API, push to Shopify as drafts
- Social media pipeline: auto-generate Facebook post drafts for new products, price drops, and stock highlights
- Image composer: generate 1200x630 social media images with sharp (3 templates: new product, price drop, highlight)
- Facebook Graph API integration: publish posts with images, schedule posts, test connection
- Settings page: configure Facebook, social workflow, content, Claude prompts (with "Test Prompt" preview), image composer (color pickers, opacity slider, live preview), Shopify and Claude API connections
- SQLite database with better-sqlite3: products, price history, facebook drafts, settings
- Simple password auth with HMAC-SHA256 signed sessions (Web Crypto API, Edge-compatible)
- Vercel cron configuration for daily sync and social highlight generation

### Fixed
- Session token forgery vulnerability: switched from broken hash to HMAC-SHA256 with constant-time comparison
- Timing attacks on cron secret: replaced === with crypto.timingSafeEqual
- Facebook access token leak: moved from URL query param to Authorization header
- SVG escapeXml missing apostrophe: added &apos; for French product names
- Auth broken in Edge middleware: migrated from Node crypto to Web Crypto API
- Catalogue page crash on missing pagination data
