# Changelog

All notable changes to Aosom Sync will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.3.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- Products are now automatically placed into the correct Shopify collection when imported, based on their Aosom category
- New /collections page to view and edit category-to-collection mappings with dropdown selectors
- "Sync Collections" button to assign existing Shopify products to their mapped collections in batch
- 35 pre-seeded mappings covering all 8 top-level Aosom categories (Patio, Home, Pets, Toys, Office, Sports, etc.)
- Hierarchical category matching: if "Patio > Furniture > Bistro Sets" has no exact mapping, it walks up to "Patio > Furniture" automatically
- Collections link added to the sidebar navigation

### Changed
- Collection sync uses in-memory mapping lookup instead of per-product DB queries (N+1 fix)

## [0.1.1.0] - 2026-04-06

### Changed
- Image composer now uses dynamic import for sharp, reducing cold start time on Vercel
- Social media images write to /tmp on Vercel (public/ is read-only in serverless)
- Facebook publish resolves image paths cross-environment via resolveImagePath()
- Sync engine loads all products in one query instead of one per CSV row (N+1 fix for 10k+ products)
- Stock change detection uses Set instead of Array.find() (O(1) vs O(n) per lookup)
